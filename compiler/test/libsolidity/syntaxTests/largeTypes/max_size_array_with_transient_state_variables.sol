// Warning 3495: (0-60): This contract is very close to the end of storage. This limits its future upgradability.
// Warning 7325: (17-33): Type uint256[115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935] covers a large part of storage and thus makes collisions likely. Either use mappings or dynamic arrays and allow their size to be increased only in small quantities per transaction.
